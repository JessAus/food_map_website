## About the Website

I created this website as a fun personal project to practice using the R Leaflet package for visualizing geographic data. As an added benefit, I hoped that this website could help me dodge arguments with my fianc√© regarding what we will eat for dinner.

This website provides a few utilities to the user:

1.  You are able to view a map of some of my favorite restaurants across DFW, which is color coded by the type of food.
2.  You may also visit the blog page where my favorite dishes are listed for each restaurant.
3.  You may view the restaurants in a more tabular format where you can filter each of the columns by type of food, price range, street/shopping center, and/or rating (as rated by yours truly).

## Affiliation(s)

I do not profit from any of the restaurants listed on this website and I have no financial ties to these establishments. I simply frequent these restaurants because I like their food.

## TL;DR

I am an indecisive data scientist who decided it would be easier to make a website than it would be to actually make a decision on what I should eat for dinner.
