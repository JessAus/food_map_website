# DFW Favorites

The map below displays my top picks for restaurants across the DFW metroplex. As you can probably tell, I haven't explored Dallas nearly enough, but I plan to add more locations to this website as time goes on.

Below the map, you will find a table which lists more details about each of the locations featured in the map section.
